INTRODUCTION
------------

To understand the nature of today's pendamic, we created this simulator entirely using numpy and matplotlib in python.

following are the files in the project:

1. motion.py: file that contains all function related to population mobility and related computations
  
2. population.py: this file contains functions that help initialize the population parameters for the simulation

3. visualizer.py: contains all methods for visualisation tasks

4. config.py: file that contains all configuration related methods and classes

5. infection.py: this file contains all functions required in computing new infections, recoveries, and deaths

6. simulation.py: this is the main file which combines all the above files and run the simulation

REQUIREMENTS
------------

It requires numpy and matplotlib libraries in python3


Run
---

To run the simulation, make sure to keep all files in same directory and then build and run simulation.py file in python.
